/*
Using JS mainly for the pricing/scheduling pg.
The goal is to use the html/css to list the pricings & times. 
Have JS use a clicking event listener and then do something. 
    - Return the price the user selects back to them asking them to confirm or cancel.
    - Then returning a new message stating 'Ok X, we'll see you on MM/DD at HH:MM. Can't wait to see you then!'
