        We take the health and cleanliness of our chickens seriously to ensure that not only do our chickens feel good, but stay happy too!
        Please keep the hygine of our pets as well as yourself in mind and take breaks to wash your hands and arms. 
        Also, we have the final say when it comes to the safety of our chickens as well as fellow guests. 
        But mostly, we want you to know everything we do, we do with care. 
        Thank you!
