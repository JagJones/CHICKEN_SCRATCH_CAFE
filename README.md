Welcome to my website for the Chicken Scratch Cafe!

The Chicken Scratch Cafe is a fictional business (though it's real in my heart) that I created to use as practice in front end web development. The main objectives with this project is to showcase what I've learned so far in html5, CSS, CSS Grid & vanilla Javascript. 

Once on the website the user should be able to go to... 
-   See a clean and appealing layout. 
-   Be able to navigate to the other pgs, see a color change when hovering over the pg links and see which pgs have already been   viewed.
-   See a color change while hovering over buttons.
-   Make a "reservation".
-   On the 'About' pg you can see the chicken names when hovering over their pics.
-   Be able to resize the webpage and see visual changes at 2 other screen sizes.
-   This includes seeing the navigation menu condense down into a 'burger' menu.
-   Fill out the forms to "set up" a visit. The forms will notify the user if their info is in the wrong format.
-   Once the user hits submit for their visit the webpage will confirm the info with an alert. 

When viewing the code you can see...
-   The use of nth of child in the CSS sheets.
