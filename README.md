Welcome to my website for the Chicken Scratch Cafe!

The Chicken Scratch Cafe is a fictional business (though it's real in my heart) that I created to use as practice in front end web development. The main objectives with this project is to showcase what I've learned so far in html5, CSS, CSS Grid & vanilla Javascript. 

Once on the website the user should be able to go to... 
-   See a clean and appealing layout. 
-   Be able to navigate to the other pgs, see a color change when hovering over the pg links and see which pgs have already been   viewed.
-   See a color change while hovering over buttons.
-   Make a "reservation".
-   On the 'About' pg you can see the chicken names when hovering over their pics.
-   Be able to resize the webpage and see visual changes at 2 other screen sizes.
-   This includes seeing the navigation menu condense down into a 'burger' menu.
-   Fill out the forms to "set up" a visit. The forms will notify the user if their info is in the wrong format.
-   Once the user hits submit for their visit the webpage will confirm the info with an alert. 

When viewing the code you can see...
-   The use of nth of child in the CSS sheets.


Project Goals:
. Use JS 3 ways
    - Return input to the user in an alert. 
    - Validate the info.
    - Burger nav.
. Have 3-4 pgs to show successful pg linking.
    - Main
    - About
    - Schedule
    - Cafe 
. Levels of media queries.
    - Mobile, 768px, and 1024px.

Function & Aesthetics Goals:
. Main Pg
    - Navigation menu is collapsable at smaller screens then expands across the page at <1024px.
    - Use CSS grid to go from 1 columns at smaller screens to 2 columns at larger screens. 
. About Pg
    - Use CSS grid to go from 1 column on small screens, 2 columns on medium screens and to 3 columns on larger screens.
    - Use CSS to create a animation which shows each chicken's name across their image.
. Scheduling Pg
    - Use HTML to create a form which the user can fill out. 
    - Use JavaScript to return the information that was entered to confirm that it's correct/ not null.
    (As of 7/25 I can only get this to work for the name field and it only confirms that the field isn't blank on the first try.)
    . Use CSS grid to again go from 1 column at smaller screens then 2 columns after <1024px.
